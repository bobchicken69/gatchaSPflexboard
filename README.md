This is designed to be used with the Game Boy Advance SP mod created by Joseph Tompkins called the <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/GachaSP_Miniature_Gameboy_Advance_SP_de96ba26.html">Gatcha SP.</a>

This flexible circuit board should make wiring the button board to the main board a lot easier.

Once it's verified to work, there will be a PCBway link here to where you can purcahse one.
