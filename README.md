# gatchaSP Flexboard

> :warning: **THIS IS UNTESTED! WE'RE STILL WORKING OUT THE SIZING. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

This is designed to be used with the Game Boy Advance SP mod created by [Joseph Tompkins](https://ko-fi.com/josephtomkins) called the [Gacha SP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM45YnBbGOQ).

This flexible circuit board should make wiring the button board to the main board a lot easier.

In addition to this flexboard you will need to source the following boards/parts:
|Part|Link|
|----|----|
|Faceplate and middle layer|[PCB Way](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/GachaSP_with_Speaker_Miniature_SP_console_4192a5ce.html)|
